I laughed.
We played.
The sun rose.
You stayed.
Time before us.

He watched.
She waited.

It called.
A melody of fire.
Nevermore.
Fallen.

December fell.
Another spell.

Out of luck.
Our well ran dry.
Least we try.

Guess who.
Yes you.

Is it ready?
Yes indeed.
Past the point.
No return.
Look up.

The sun set.
I realized.
Time flew by.
Who am I?

Key.
Maybe?
She unlocked it.
Planted destiny
Fates interwoven.

You see.
It is written.
Lain out.

Cannot trust.
Gain sight.
Find the light.
In the void.
Angels rise.

Rely on none.
Accept.
The one.

On the clock.
It points.
Frozen.
Eternity.

Luck died.
Tiger's blood.
